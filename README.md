# Snowplow-Routing-Middleton

Updated repository for my solution to the snowplow routing problem, where my code has been documented and rearranged into modules. A detailed description of the project, as well as the results I've obtained, can be found on the following website that I created:
https://ian1528.github.io/snowplow-results-website/ 

The original repository that I started the project in, consisting almost entirely of jupyter notebooks, can be found [here](https://github.com/Ian1528/Snowplow-Route-Optimization).
